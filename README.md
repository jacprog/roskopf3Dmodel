I have designed a 3D printable watch based on a Roskopf Watch<br>
The biography of G.F. Roskopf, the inventor and a descrition of the watch can be found in this free book here:<br>

My design, at this point is 144 mm in diameter (not including the stem) and about 90 mm high<br>
Still far from the size of a pocket watch, but maybe one day I will get there<br>
