I have designed a 3D printable watch based on a Roskopf Watch
The biography of G.F. Roskopf, the inventor and a descrition of the watch can be found in this free book here:

And in french here:

My design, at this point is 144 mm in diameter (not including the stem) and about 90 mm high
Still far from the size of a pocket watch, but maybe one day I will get there
